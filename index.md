Welcome üëã <br>
I'm Joshua Bloom, a product & design leader based in San Francisco üåÅ. 

Currently I work as a UX Design Manager at [Google](https://google.com/) for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). I focus on building high performing, resilient design and research teams.
My teams create, launch and land innovative new products like [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) and [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows), as well as continually enhancing and improving our existing product portfolio to help our customers.

I've worked across hardware, software and service design projects and find it especially rewarding when there are design opportunities bringing all of those surfaces together to build products that users love.

## Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience to bear on crafting excellent product design experiences.

I spent five years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com), a couple of years in corporate life helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile phones better, and four years building product design portfolios for San Francisco bay area startups including [SKULLY](https://www.revzilla.com/common-tread/skully-ar-1-helmet-preview) & [wrap](https://wrap.co).
