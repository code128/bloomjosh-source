Welcome üëã <br>
I'm Josh Bloom, a product & design leader based in San Francisco üåÅ. 

At [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), I build high performing UX design teams, focused on creating products that simplify cloud complexity for our customers.

My teams build, launch and land innovative new products like
- [Application Design Center](https://cloud.google.com/application-design-center/docs/overview) (design & deploy cloud infrastructure)
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (serverless containers)
- [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows) (microservice orchestration)

In addition to new products, we constantly improve our existing products.

I've worked successfully across hardware, software and service design, and find it especially rewarding discovering product  opportunities by focusing on holistic customer journeys.

## Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience to bear on crafting excellent product design experiences.

I spent five years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com), a couple of years in corporate life helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile phones better, and four years building product design portfolios for San Francisco bay area startups including [SKULLY](https://www.revzilla.com/common-tread/skully-ar-1-helmet-preview) & [wrap](https://wrap.co).
