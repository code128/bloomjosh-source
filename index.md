Welcome üëã <br>
I'm Josh Bloom, a product & design leader based in San Francisco üåÅ. 

At [Google](https://cloud.google.com), I focus on building and scaling high-performing UX design and research teams. I lead them to tackle complex, large-scale problems‚Äîfrom simplifying cloud infrastructure to designing intuitive, application-centric experiences used by millions of customers daily.

My teams build, launch and land innovative new products including:
- [Application Design Center](https://cloud.google.com/application-design-center/docs/overview) (design & deploy cloud infrastructure)
- [App Hub](https://cloud.google.com/products/app-hub) (manage your applications)
- [Cloud Hub](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-hub/home) (central command for your application landscape)
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (deploy serverless containers)

Learn more about the application-centric cloud I'm building at [this blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/an-application-centric-ai-powered-cloud)

I thrive on discovering product opportunities by focusing on holistic customer needs through journeys that span hardware, software, and service design. My work at companies like Samsung, frog and SKULLY has centered on solving converged hardware and software challenges. especially when there are paradigm changing new technologies available to create with.

### Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience to bear on crafting excellent product design experiences.

I spent five years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com) focused on convergent hardware and software challenges, a couple of years helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile OS and devices story more connected, and four years building product design portfolios for San Francisco bay area startups including [SKULLY](https://www.revzilla.com/common-tread/skully-ar-1-helmet-preview) & [wrap](https://wrap.co).

##### Superflous FAQ
- What motorcycle are you currently riding? [*2016 KTM 1190R Adventure*](https://www.advpulse.com/adv-bikes/2015-ktm-1190-adventure-r-review/)
- How tall are you? *6' 5"*
- How many kids do you have? *2*
- How much time elapses between when you wake up and when you drink an espresso? *I average about 5-10 minutes, but [research](https://www.betterup.com/blog/best-time-to-drink-coffee) suggests waiting 30-90 minutes for your first cup can give you a higher stimulant effect with less jitter as your cortisol levels have lowered.*
