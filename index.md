Welcome, I'm Joshua Bloom, a product & design leader.

I'm currently a UX Design Manager for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) on the Foundation Services team where I focus on building high performing design and research teams. My teams work to launch new products for our customers and enhance our existing offerings. 

### Background

Originally trained as a software engineer, I went back to [school](https://massart.edu/) to study Industrial Design, and now bring all of my experience to bear on crafting excellent product design experiences.

I spent five years at one of the world's best design consultancies, [frog](https://frogdesign.com), a couple of years in corporate life helping make [Samsung's](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/) mobile phones better, and four years building product design portfolios for San Francisco bay area startups including [SKULLY](https://www.revzilla.com/common-tread/skully-ar-1-helmet-preview) & [wrap](https://wrap.co).
