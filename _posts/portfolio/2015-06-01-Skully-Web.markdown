### The SKULLY web experience was a multifaceted home page for SKULLY. It was our main communication method with our pre-order customers and was built to grow into a social network hub as the product rolled out.  

In the early days of the site there were a few main goals: generate excitement, embody the SKULLY brand, educate prospective customers and push pre-order sales.
