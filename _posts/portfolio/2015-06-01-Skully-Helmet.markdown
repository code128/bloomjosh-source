### The SKULLY AR-1 helmet was the world's first augmented reality motorcycle helmet. Featuring a 180 degree rear view camera and a heads up display, it was a figher pilot helmet for motorcycle riders. 

I hired and led the Design Team at SKULLY and personally did hands on design work for everything needed for a complete experience from: physical helmet parts, in helmet UI, mobile companion applications and websites to shipping boxes and marketing collateral. 

I joined SKULLY as the VP of Design and expanded my role into VP of Product as we began planning multiple products and the larger SKULLY ecosystem.

+ **Role:** VP Product
+ **Team Size:** (5) 1 Industrial Designer, 1 Visual Designer, 3 Mechanical Engineers
+ **Company:** [SKULLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skully_(helmet))
+ **Time Period:** Mid 2015

Big thanks on this project to the inimitable talents of designers [Jeff Broderick](http://brdrck.me/) and [Donald Burlock](http://www.theburlockgroup.com).
