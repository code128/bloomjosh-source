### Samsung asked our UX Lab for a complete redesign of a mobile operating system, looking for a way to differentiate from the grid of apps that still greets mobile phone users today.

My team embarked on an intensive research period where we deeply understood global user behavior and began developing the insights that would translate into a new mobile OS paradigm. 

+ **Role:** Creative Director
+ **Team Size:** (8-18) 2 phase project. 8 designers (UX, Visual, Motion) during design/research expanding to 18 (including a remote Android Development team) during the prototype development phase.
+ **Company:** [Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/)
+ **Time Period:** Early 2013
