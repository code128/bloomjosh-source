### The SKULLY web experience was a multifaceted home page for SKULLY. It was our main communication method with our pre-order customers and was built to grow into a social network hub as the product rolled out.  

In the early days of the site there were a few main goals: generate excitement, embody the SKULLY brand, educate prospective customers and push pre-order sales.

+ **Role:** VP Design (player/coach)
+ **Team:** (7) 1 Visual Designer, 1 Creative Director, 1 Creative Engineer, 1 Copywriter, 1 Front end developer, 1 Photographer, 1 Videographer
+ **Company:** [SKULLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skully_(helmet))
+ **Time Period:** Mid 2015
